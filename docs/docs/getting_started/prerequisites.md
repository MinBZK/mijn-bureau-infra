# Prerequisites

MijnBureau does not have many prerequisites except for a Kubernetes cluster.

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Cluster

Minimal Kubernetes cluster requirements:

- A [CNCF certified Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) installation.
- AMD64 platform
- A LoadBalancer
- A ingress controller: Nginx or HAProxy-openshift

Currently MijnBureau only supports the Nginx and HAProxy ingress controller but more can be added if needed.

### Kubernetes resources

We tried to make resource setup easy and have a global size parameter that changes the resources used for all components of MijnBureau. Bellow a list of expected resource usage depending on the size parameter. The resource usage bellow are for the default settings. If you want to enable/disable components and recalculate the resource usage you can use the ./script/predicted_resources.py. Since we are still adding components and not updating these values every time they might be slightly off.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

To install MijnBureau on Kubernetes you need some tools. We use Helmfile to generate all the Kubernetes manifests but you could also use Flux or ArgoCD with some small edits. To use Helmfile you will need to install:

- [Helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

If you plan to store secrets like credentials, we recommend using a encryption tool or secret manager. In this documentation we will use sops, but there are many more that you could consider. It depends on your organization what is best.

## üåê Domain Configuration

Since MijnBureau as mainly a browser based suite, you will need a domain or subdomain you control so the tool can be made available to users.

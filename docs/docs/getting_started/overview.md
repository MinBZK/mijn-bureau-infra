## Features

Before getting started, consider which features you want to use and how MijnBureau fits within your organization. Here are some examples:

- **Identity Provider**: MijnBureau can deploy an identity provider, or you can integrate your existing one.
- **AI Language Models**: Deploy a local AI LLM with MijnBureau, or configure an existing one.
- **Transactional Email**: Connect MijnBureau to a transactional email provider, or disable email sending entirely.

MijnBureau is designed to make logical default choices based on your configuration setup. However, there are many considerations you might need to make depending on your specific requirements.

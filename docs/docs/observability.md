# Observability

Observability is an important feature on the roadmap for MijnBureau. While it is not yet implemented, we have clear plans to introduce it in the near future.

## Planned Features

- **Prometheus Operator Integration**: We plan to leverage the [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/) to enable monitoring across all tools in MijnBureau. This will include:
  - Service Monitors
  - Pod Monitors

- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-configured Grafana dashboards will be prepared to provide easy insights into MijnBureau's performance and metrics.

- **Phased Approach**:
  1. **Metrics**: Start with collecting and visualizing metrics.
  2. **Logging**: Add logging capabilities to enhance troubleshooting.
  3. **Tracing**: Explore adding tracing functionality in the future.

Stay tuned for updates as we work to enhance observability in MijnBureau.

# Airgap

Airgapped environments, which lack internet access, require special preparation. This documentation outlines the steps needed to set up MijnBureau in such environments. Ensure all required tools, repositories, charts, and containers are downloaded and transferred to a datastore that can be moved to the airgapped environment.

## Download Tools

Download the following tools and their required plugins:

- **Helmfile**: [Installation Guide](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)
- **Helm**: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

# ADR-MB-002: Kubernetes as the deployment platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a reliable, scalable, and flexible deployment platform to run and manage our containerized applications across different environments. Many options are available, like kubernetes, VMs, Docker swarm

## Decision
We will use Kubernetes as our standard deployment platform for all environments. We will assume a [Haven](https://haven.commonground.nl/) compliant cluster.

## Consequences
✅ Enables a consistent deployment model across environments
✅ Improves scalability, observability, and resilience of applications
✅ Leverages ecosystem tools for CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and security
❌ Increases complexity and learning curve for development teams
❌ Requires ongoing cluster management and resource tuning
❌ Potential overkill for small/simple apps unless managed Kubernetes (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS) is used
